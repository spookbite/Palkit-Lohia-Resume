% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\item \textbf{POS tagging}: Implemented a system to assign a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective,etc.), using \textbf{Markov chains and Virtebri algorithm}, to each word in an input text.
\item \textbf{Document Search}: Used \textbf{Locality Sensitive Hashing and approximate K-NN}, to find tweets similar to a given tweet.
\item \textbf{Auto Correct}: Implemented an Auto-correct system using \textbf{Levenshtein distance and word probabilities}
\item \textbf{Auto Complete}: Implemented an Auto-complete system using the \textbf{N-gram Language Model} and \textbf{perplexity} to calculate the score.
\item Implemented a system to predict the countries given its capital city using \textbf{euclidean distance and cosine similarity}.
\item \textbf{Sentiment Analysis} of tweets using \textbf{Logistic Regression} and \textbf{Naive Bayes theorem}.
